The revolution of modern physics began to be reflected 
in the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i> in the Twelfth Edition 
(1922), with James (later Sir James) H. Jeans' article on "Relativity." 
In the Thirteenth Edition (1926) a wholly new topic, "Space-Time," 
was discussed by the person most qualified in all the world 
to do so, Albert Einstein. The article is challenging but rewarding.

<b>SPACE-TIME</b><br><br>

All our thoughts and concepts are called up 
by sense-experiences and have a meaning only in reference to 
these sense-experiences. On the other hand, however, they are 
products of the spontaneous activity of our minds; they are 
thus in no wise logical consequences of the contents of these 
sense-experiences. If, therefore, we wish to grasp the essence 
of a complex of abstract notions we must for the one part investigate 
the mutual relationships between the concepts and the assertions 
made about them; for the other, we must investigate how they 
are related to the experiences.

<br><br>

So far as the way is concerned in which concepts are connected 
with one another and with the experiences there is no difference 
of principle between the concept-systems of science and those 
of daily life. The concept-systems of science have grown out 
of those of daily life and have been modified and completed 
according to the objects and purposes of the science in question.

<br><br>

The more universal a concept is the more frequently it enters 
into our thinking; and the more indirect its relation to sense-experience, 
the more difficult it is for us to comprehend its meaning; this 
is particularly the case with pre-scientific concepts that we 
have been accustomed to use since childhood. Consider the concepts 
referred to in the words "where," "when," "why," "being," to 
the elucidation of which innumerable volumes of philosophy have 
been devoted. We fare no better in our speculations than a fish 
which should strive to become clear as to what is water.

SPACE

</span>

<br><br>

In the present article we are concerned with the meaning of 
"where," that is, of space. It appears that there is no quality 
contained in our individual primitive sense-experiences that 
may be designated as spatial. Rather, what is spatial appears 
to be a sort of order of the material objects of experience. 
The concept "material object" must therefore be available if 
concepts concerning space are to be possible. It is the logically 
primary concept. This is easily seen if we analyse the spatial 
concepts for example, "next to," "touch," and so forth, that 
is, if we strive to become aware of their equivalents in experience. 
The concept "object" is a means of taking into account the persistence 
in time or the continuity, respectively, of certain groups of 
experience-complexes. The existence of objects is thus of a 
conceptual nature, and the meaning of the concepts of objects 
depends wholly on their being connected (intuitively) with groups 
of elementary sense-experiences. This connection is the basis 
of the illusion which makes primitive experience appear to inform 
us directly about the relation of material bodies (which exist, 
after all, only in so far as they are thought).

<br><br>

In the sense thus indicated we have (the indirect) experience 
of the contact of two bodies. We need do no more than call attention 
to this, as we gain nothing for our present purpose by singling 
out the individual experiences to which this assertion alludes. 
Many bodies can be brought into permanent contact with one another 
in manifold ways. We speak in this sense of the position-relationships 
of bodies (<i>Lagenbeziehungen</i>). The general laws of such 
position-relationships are essentially the concern of geometry. 
This holds, at least, if we do not wish to restrict ourselves 
to regarding the propositions that occur in this branch of knowledge 
merely as relationships between empty words that have been set 
up according to certain principles.

<br><br>

<i>Pre-scientific Thought.</i>--Now, what is the meaning of 
the concept "space" which we also encounter in pre-scientific 
thought? The concept of space in pre-scientific thought is characterised 
by the sentence: "we can think away things but not the space 
which they occupy." It is as if, without having had experience 
of any sort, we had a concept, nay even a presentation, of space 
and as if we ordered our sense-experiences with the help of 
this concept, present <i>a priori</i>. On the other hand, space 
appears as a physical reality, as a thing which exists independently 
of our thought, like material objects. Under the influence of 
this view of space the fundamental concepts of geometry: the 
point, the straight line, the plane, were even regarded as having 
a self-evident character. The fundamental principles that deal 
with these configurations were regarded as being necessarily 
valid and as having at the same time an objective content. No 
scruples were felt about ascribing an objective meaning to such 
statements as "three empirically given bodies (practically infinitely 
small) lie on one straight line," without demanding a physical 
definition for such an assertion. This blind faith in evidence 
and in the immediately real meaning of the concepts and propositions 
of geometry became uncertain only after non-Euclidean geometry 
had been introduced.

<br><br>

<i>Reference to the Earth.</i>--If we start from the view that 
all spatial concepts are related to contact-experiences of solid 
bodies, it is easy to understand how the concept "space" originated, 
namely, how a thing independent of bodies and yet embodying 
their position-possibilities (<i>Lagerungsm&ouml;glichkeiten</i>) 
was posited. If we have a system of bodies in contact and at 
rest relatively to one another, some can be replaced by others. 
This property of allowing substitution is interpreted as "available 
space." Space denotes the property in virtue of which rigid 
bodies can occupy different positions. The view that space is 
something with a unity of its own is perhaps due to the circumstance 
that in pre-scientific thought all positions of bodies were 
referred to one body (reference body), namely the earth. In 
scientific thought the earth is represented by the co-ordinate 
system. The assertion that it would be possible to place an 
unlimited number of bodies next to one another denotes that 
space is infinite. In pre-scientific thought the concepts "space" 
and "time" and "body of reference" are scarcely differentiated 
at all. A place or point in space is always taken to mean a 
material point on a body of reference.

<br><br>

<i>Euclidean Geometry.</i>--If we consider Euclidean geometry 
we clearly discern that it refers to the laws regulating the 
positions of rigid bodies. It turns to account the ingenious 
thought of tracing back all relations concerning bodies and 
their relative positions to the very simple concept "distance" 
(<i>Strecke</i>). Distance denotes a rigid body on which two 
material points (marks) have been specified. The concept of 
the equality of distances (and angles) refers to experiments 
involving coincidences; the same remarks apply to the theorems 
on congruence. Now, Euclidean geometry, in the form in which 
it has been handed down to us from Euclid, uses the fundamental 
concepts "straight line" and "plane" which do not appear to 
correspond, or at any rate, not so directly, with experiences 
concerning the position of rigid bodies. On this it must be 
remarked that the concept of the straight line may be reduced 
to that of the distance.<img src="sup1.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 1}">
Moreover, geometricians were less concerned with bringing out 
the relation of their fundamental concepts to experience than 
with deducing logically the geometrical propositions from a 
few axioms enunciated at the outset.

<br><br>

<img src="sup1.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 1}">A hint 
of this is contained in the theorem: "the straight line is the 
shortest connection between two points." This theorem served 
well as a definition of the straight line, although the definition 
played no part in the logical texture of the deductions.

<br><br>

Let us outline briefly how perhaps the basis of Euclidean geometry 
may be gained from the concept of distance.

<br><br>

We start from the equality of distances (axiom of the equality 
of distances). Suppose that of two unequal distances one is 
always greater than the other. The same axioms are to hold for 
the inequality of distances as hold for the inequality of numbers.

<br><br>

Three distances AB<img src="sup1.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 1}">
, BC<img src="sup1.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 1}">, CA<img src="sup1.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 1}">
may, if CA<img src="sup1.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 1}">
be suitably chosen, have their marks BB<img src="sup1.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 1}">
, CC<img src="sup1.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 1}">, AA<img src="sup1.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 1}">
superposed on one another in such a way that a triangle ABC 
results. The distance CA<img src="sup1.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 1}">
has an upper limit for which this construction is still just 
possible. The points A, (BB') and C then lie in a "straight 
line" (definition). This leads to the concepts: producing a 
distance by an amount equal to itself; dividing a distance into 
equal parts; expressing a distance in terms of a number by means 
of a measuring-rod (definition of the space-interval between 
two points).

<br><br>

When the concept of the interval between two points or the 
length of a distance has been gained in this way we require 
only the following axiom (Pythagoras' theorem) in order to arrive 
at Euclidean geometry analytically.

<br><br>

To every point of space (body of reference) three numbers (co-ordinates) 
x, y, z may be assigned--and conversely--in such a way that 
for each pair of points A (x<img src="sub1.gif" align=middle alt="{sub 1}">
, y<img src="sub1.gif" align=middle alt="{sub 1}">, z<img src="sub1.gif" align=middle alt="{sub 1}">
) and B (x<img src="sub2.gif" align=middle alt="{sub 2}">, 
y<img src="sub2.gif" align=middle alt="{sub 2}">, z<img src="sub2.gif" align=middle alt="{sub 2}">
) the theorem holds:

<br><br>

measure-number

<br><br>

AB = {sqroot (x<img src="sub2.gif" align=middle alt="{sub 2}">
 - x<img src="sub1.gif" align=middle alt="{sub 1}">)<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}">
 + (y<img src="sub2.gif" align=middle alt="{sub 2}"> - 
y<img src="sub1.gif" align=middle alt="{sub 1}">)<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}">
 + (z<img src="sub2.gif" align=middle alt="{sub 2}"> - 
z<img src="sub1.gif" align=middle alt="{sub 1}">)<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}">
}

<br><br>

All further concepts and propositions of Euclidean geometry 
can then be built up purely logically on this basis, in particular 
also the propositions about the straight line and the plane.

<br><br>

These remarks are not, of course, intended to replace the strictly 
axiomatic construction of Euclidean geometry. We merely wish 
to indicate plausibly how all conceptions of geometry may be 
traced back to that of distance. We might equally well have 
epitomised the whole basis of Euclidean geometry in the last 
theorem above. The relation to the foundations of experience 
would then be furnished by means of a supplementary theorem.

<br><br>

The co-ordinate may and <i>must</i> be chosen so that two pairs 
of points separated by equal intervals, as calculated by the 
help of Pythagoras' theorem, may be made to coincide with one 
and the same suitably chosen distance (on a solid).

<br><br>

The concepts and propositions of Euclidean geometry may be 
derived from Pythagoras' proposition without the introduction 
of rigid bodies; but these concepts and propositions would not 
then have contents that could be tested. They are not "true" 
propositions but only logically correct propositions of purely 
formal content.

<br><br>

<i>Difficulties.</i>--A serious difficulty is encountered in 
the above represented interpretation of geometry in that the 
rigid body of experience does not correspond <i>exactly</i> with 
the geometrical body. In stating this I am thinking less of 
the fact that there are no absolutely definite marks than that 
temperature, pressure and other circumstances modify the laws 
relating to position. It is also to be recollected that the 
structural constituents of matter (such as atom and electron, 
<i>q.v.</i>) assumed by physics are not in principle commensurate 
with rigid bodies, but that nevertheless the concepts of geometry 
are applied to them and to their parts. For this reason consistent 
thinkers have been disinclined to allow real contents of facts 
(<i>reale Tatsachenbest&auml;nde</i>) to correspond to geometry 
alone. They considered it preferable to allow the content of 
experience (<i>Erfahrungsbest&auml;nde</i>) to correspond to 
geometry and physics conjointly.

<br><br>

This view is certainly less open to attack than the one represented 
above; as opposed to the atomic theory it is the only one that 
can be consistently carried through. Nevertheless, in the opinion 
of the author it would not be advisable to give up the first 
view, from which geometry derives its origin. This connection 
is essentially founded on the belief that the ideal rigid body 
is an abstraction that is well rooted in the laws of nature.

<br><br>

<i>Foundations of Geometry.</i>--We come now to the question: 
what is <i>a priori</i> certain or necessary, respectively in 
geometry (doctrine of space) or its foundations? Formerly we 
thought everything--yes, everything; nowadays we think--nothing. 
Already the distance-concept is logically arbitrary; there need 
be no things that correspond to it, even approximately. Something 
similar may be said of the concepts straight line, plane, of 
three-dimensionality and of the validity of Pythagoras' theorem. 
Nay, even the continuum-doctrine is in no wise given with the 
nature of human thought, so that from the epistemological point 
of view no greater authority attaches to the purely topological 
relations than to the others.

<br><br>

<i>Earlier Physical Concepts.</i>--We have yet to deal with 
those modifications in the space-concept, which have accompanied 
the advent of the theory of relativity. For this purpose we 
must consider the space-concept of the earlier physics from 
a point of view different from that above. If we apply the theorem 
of Pythagoras to infinitely near points, it reads

<br><br>

ds<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}"> = dx<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}">
+ dy<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}"> + 
dz<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}"> 

<br><br>

where ds denotes the measurable interval between them. For an 
empirically-given ds the co-ordinate system is not yet fully 
determined for every combination of points by this equation. 
Besides being translated, a co-ordinate system may also be rotated.<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}">
This signifies analytically: the relations of Euclidean geometry 
are covariant with respect to linear orthogonal transformations 
of the co-ordinates.

<br><br>

<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}">Change 
of direction of the co-ordinate axes while their orthogonality 
is preserved.

<br><br>

In applying Euclidean geometry to pre-relativistic mechanics 
a further indeterminateness enters through the choice of the 
co-ordinate system: the state of motion of the co-ordinate system 
is arbitrary to a certain degree, namely, in that substitutions 
of the co-ordinates of the form

<br><br>

x' = x - vt

<br><br>

y' = y

<br><br>

z' = z

<br><br>

also appear possible. On the other hand, earlier mechanics did 
not allow co-ordinate systems to be applied of which the states 
of motion were different from those expressed in these equations. 
In this sense we speak of "inertial systems." In these favoured-inertial 
systems we are confronted with a new property of space so far 
as geometrical relations are concerned. Regarded more accurately, 
this is not a property of space alone but of the four-dimensional 
continuum consisting of time and space conjointly.

<br><br>

<i>Appearance of Time.</i>--At this point time enters explicitly 
into our discussion for the first time. In their applications 
space (place) and time always occur together. Every event that 
happens in the world is determined by the space-co-ordinates 
x, y, z, and the time-co-ordinate t. Thus the physical description 
was four-dimensional right from the beginning. But this four-dimensional 
continuum seemed to resolve itself into the three-dimensional 
continuum of space and the one-dimensional continuum of time. 
This apparent resolution owed its origin to the illusion that 
the meaning of the concept "simultaneity" is self-evident, and 
this illusion arises from the fact that we receive news of near 
events almost instantaneously owing to the agency of light.

<br><br>

This faith in the absolute significance of simultaneity was 
destroyed by the law regulating the propagation of light in 
empty space or, respectively, by the Maxwell-Lorentz electrodynamics. 
Two infinitely near points can be connected by means of a light-signal 
if the relation

<br><br>

ds<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}"> = c<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}">
dt<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}"> - dx<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}">
- dy<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}"> - 
dz<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}"> = 0 

<br><br>

holds for them. It further follows that ds has a value which, 
for arbitrarily chosen infinitely near space-time points, is 
independent of the particular inertial system selected. In agreement 
with this we find that for passing from one inertial system 
to another, linear equations of transformation hold which do 
not in general leave the time-values of the events unchanged. 
It thus became manifest that the four-dimensional continuum 
of space cannot be split up into a time-continuum and a space-continuum 
except in an arbitrary way. This invariant quantity ds may be 
measured by means of measuring-rods and clocks.

<br><br>

<i>Four-Dimensional Geometry.</i>--On the invariant ds a four-dimensional 
geometry may be built up which is in a large measure analogous 
to Euclidean geometry in three dimensions. In this way physics 
becomes a sort of statics in a four-dimensional continuum. Apart 
from the difference in the number of dimensions the latter continuum 
is distinguished from that of Euclidean geometry in that ds<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}">
may be greater or less than zero. Corresponding to this we 
differentiate between time-like and space-like line-elements. 
The boundary between them is marked out by the element of the 
"light-cone" ds<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}">
= 0 which starts out from every point. If we consider only 
elements which belong to the same time-value, we have

<br><br>

- ds<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}"> = 
dx<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}"> + dy<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}">
+ dz<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}"> 

<br><br>

These elements ds may have real counterparts in distances at 
rest and, as before, Euclidean geometry holds for these elements.

<br><br>

<i>Effect of Relativity, Special and General.</i>--This is 
the modification which the doctrine of space and time has undergone 
through the restricted theory of relativity. The doctrine of 
space has been still further modified by the general theory 
of relativity, because this theory denies that the three-dimensional 
spatial section of the space-time continuum is Euclidean in 
character. Therefore it asserts that Euclidean geometry does 
not hold for the relative positions of bodies that are continuously 
in contact.

<br><br>

For the empirical law of the equality of inertial and gravitational 
mass led us to interpret the state of the continuum, in so far 
as it manifests itself with reference to a non-inertial system, 
as a gravitational field and to treat non-inertial systems as 
equivalent to inertial systems. Referred to such a system, which 
is connected with the inertial system by a non-linear transformation 
of the co-ordinates, the metrical invariant ds<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}">
assumes the general form:--

<br><br>

ds<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}"> = <img src="ucgsigma.gif" alt="{sigma}">
<i><img src="lcgmu.gif" alt="{mu}"></i><i><img src="lcgnu.gif" alt="{nu}">
</i>g{sub <i><img src="lcgmu.gif" alt="{mu}"><img src="lcgnu.gif" alt="{nu}">
</i>}dx<img src="gsbmu.gif" align=middle alt="{sub mu}">
dx<img src="gsbnu.gif" align=middle alt="{sub nu}"> 

<br><br>

where the g{sub <i><img src="lcgmu.gif" alt="{mu}"><img src="lcgnu.gif" alt="{nu}">
</i>}'s are functions of the co-ordinates and where the sum 
is to be taken over the indices for all combinations 11, 12, 
. . . 44. The variability of the g{sub <i><img src="lcgmu.gif" alt="{mu}">
<img src="lcgnu.gif" alt="{nu}"></i>}'s is equivalent 
to the existence of a gravitational field. If the gravitational 
field is sufficiently general it is not possible at all to find 
an inertial system, that is, a co-ordinate system with reference 
to which ds<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}">
may be expressed in the simple form given above:--

<br><br>

ds<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}"> = c<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}">
dt<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}"> - dx<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}">
- dy<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}"> - 
dz<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}"> 

<br><br>

But in this case, too, there is in the infinitesimal neighbourhood 
of a space-time point a local system of reference for which 
the last-mentioned simple form for ds holds.

<br><br>

This state of the facts leads to a type of geometry which Riemann's 
genius created more than half a century before the advent of 
the general theory of relativity of which Riemann divined the 
high importance for physics.

<br><br>

<i>Riemann's Geometry.</i>--Riemann's geometry of an n-dimensional 
space bears the same relation to Euclidean geometry of an n-dimensional 
space as the general geometry of curved surfaces bears to the 
geometry of the plane. For the infinitesimal neighbourhood of 
a point on a curved surface there is a local co-ordinate system 
in which the distance ds between two infinitely near points 
is given by the equation

<br><br>

ds<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}"> = dx<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}">
+ dy<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}"> 

<br><br>

For any arbitrary (Gaussian) co-ordinate-system, however, an expression of the form

<br><br>

ds<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}"> = g{sub 
11}dx<img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}"> + 
2g{sub 12}dx<img src="sub1.gif" align=middle alt="{sub 1}">
dx<img src="sub2.gif" align=middle alt="{sub 2}"> + g{sub 
22}dx<img src="sub2.gif" align=middle alt="{sub 2}"><img src="sup2.gif" align=bottom alt="{sup 2}">

<br><br> 

holds in a finite region of the curved surface. If the g{sub 
<i><img src="lcgmu.gif" alt="{mu}"><img src="lcgnu.gif" alt="{nu}">
</i>}'s are given as functions of x<img src="sub1.gif" align=middle alt="{sub 1}">
and x<img src="sub2.gif" align=middle alt="{sub 2}"> 
the surface is then fully determined geometrically. For from 
this formula we can calculate for every combination of two infinitely 
near points on the surface the length ds of the minute rod connecting 
them; and with the help of this formula all networks that can 
be constructed on the surface with these little rods can be 
calculated. In particular, the "curvature" at every point of 
the surface can be calculated; this is the quantity that expresses 
to what extent and in what way the laws regulating the positions 
of the minute rods in the immediate vicinity of the point under 
consideration deviate from those of the geometry of the plane.

<br><br>

This theory of surfaces by Gauss has been extended by Riemann 
to continua of any arbitrary number of dimensions and has thus 
paved the way for the general theory of relativity. For it was 
shown above that corresponding to two infinitely near space-time 
points there is a number ds which can be obtained by measurement 
with rigid measuring-rods and clocks (in the case of time-like 
elements, indeed, with a clock alone). This quantity occurs 
in the mathematical theory in place of the length of the minute 
rods in three-dimensional geometry. The curves for which <img src="integral.gif" alt="{integral}">
ds has stationary values determine the paths of material points 
and rays of light in the gravitational field, and the "curvature" 
of space is dependent on the matter distributed over space.

<br><br>

Just as in Euclidean geometry the space-concept refers to the 
position-possibilities of rigid bodies, so in the general theory 
of relativity the space-time-concept refers to the behaviour 
of rigid bodies and clocks. But the space-time-continuum differs 
from the space-continuum in that the laws regulating the behaviour 
of these objects (clocks and measuring-rods) depend on where 
they happen to be. The continuum (or the quantities that describe 
it) enters explicitly into the laws of nature, and conversely 
these properties of the continuum are determined by physical 
factors. The relations that connect space and time can no longer

Nothing certain is known of what the properties of the space-time-continuum 
may be as a whole. Through the general theory of relativity, 
however, the view that the continuum is infinite in its time-like 
extent but finite in its space-like extent has gained in probability.

TIME

</span>

<br><br>

The physical time-concept answers to the time-concept of the 
extra-scientific mind. Now, the latter has its root in the time-order 
of the experiences of the individual, and this order we must 
accept as something primarily given.

<br><br>

I experience the moment "now," or, expressed more accurately, 
the present sense-experience (<i>Sinnen-Erlebnis</i>) combined 
with the recollection of (earlier) sense-experiences. That is 
why the sense-experiences seem to form a series, namely the 
time-series indicated by "earlier" and "later." The experience-series 
is thought of as a one-dimensional continuum. Experience-series 
can repeat themselves and can then be recognised. They can also 
be repeated inexactly, wherein some events are replaced by others 
without the character of the repetition becoming lost for us. 
In this way we form the time-concept as a one-dimensional frame 
which can be filled in by experiences in various ways. The same 
series of experiences answer to the same subjective time-intervals.

<br><br>

The transition from this "subjective" time (<i>Ich-Zeit</i>) 
to the time-concept of pre-scientific thought is connected with 
the formation of the idea that there is a real external world 
independent of the subject. In this sense the (objective) event 
is made to correspond with the subjective experience. In the 
same sense there is attributed to the "subjective" time of the 
experience a "time" of the corresponding "objective" event. 
In contrast with experiences external events and their order 
in time claim validity for all subjects.

<br><br>

This process of objectification would encounter no difficulties 
were the time-order of the experiences corresponding to a series 
of external events the same for all individuals. In the case 
of the immediate visual perceptions of our daily lives, this 
correspondence is exact. That is why the idea that there is 
an objective time-order became established to an extraordinary 
extent. In working out the idea of an objective world of external 
events in greater detail, it was found necessary to make events 
and experiences depend on each other in a more complicated way. 
This was at first done by means of rules and modes of thought 
instinctively gained, in which the conception of space plays 
a particularly prominent part. This process of refinement leads 
ultimately to natural science.

<br><br>

The measurement of time is effected by means of clocks. A clock 
is a thing which automatically passes in succession through 
a (practically) equal series of events (period). The number 
of periods (clock-time) elapsed serves as a measure of time. 
The meaning of this definition is at once clear if the event 
occurs in the immediate vicinity of the clock in space; for 
all observers then observe the same clock-time simultaneously 
with the event (by means of the eye) independently of their 
position. Until the theory of relativity was propounded it was 
assumed that the conception of simultaneity had an absolute 
objective meaning also for events separated in space.

<br><br>

This assumption was demolished by the discovery of the law 
of propagation of light. For if the velocity of light in empty 
space is to be a quantity that is independent of the choice 
(or, respectively, of the state of motion) of the inertial system 
to which it is referred, no absolute meaning can be assigned 
to the conception of the simultaneity of events that occur at 
points separated by a distance in space. Rather, a special time 
must be allocated to every inertial system. If no co-ordinate 
system (inertial system) is used as a basis of reference there 
is no sense in asserting that events at different points in 
space occur simultaneously. It is in consequence of this that 
space and time are welded together into a uniform four-dimensional 
continuum.
